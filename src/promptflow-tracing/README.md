## Introduction

The `promptflow-tracing` package offers tracing capabilities to capture and illustrate the internal execution processes of both DAG flow and Flex flow. It is designed to be compatible with [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/). This makes it a valuable tool for Flex flow developers who use various frameworks (such as langchain, semantic kernel, OpenAI, and various agents) to build LLM-based applications. By using promptflow-tracing, developers can achieve comprehensive observability of their LLM applications.
