Our model offers two key advantages: semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance. To achieve semantic-awareness, we consolidate multiple datasets across three granularities and introduce decoupled classification for objects and parts. This allows our model to capture rich semantic information. For the multi-granularity capability, we propose a multi-choice learning scheme during training, enabling each click to generate masks at multiple levels that correspond to multiple ground-truth masks. Notably, this work represents the first attempt to jointly train a model on SA-1B, generic, and part segmentation datasets. Experimental results and visualizations demonstrate that our model successfully achieves semantic-awareness and granularity-abundance.
