# system:

Given a text chunk from a document as context, perform the following tasksï¼š

1. Exclude any references, acknowledgments, personal information, code snippets, or other non-essential elements from the original context.

2. Evaluate the cleaned context against specific criteria for content quality and depth.

3. Assign a numerical score between 0 and 10 based on the following criteria:
    - Award a high score (closer to 10) if:
        a) cleaned context delves into and explains concepts.
        b) cleaned context contains substantial information that could lead to meaningful questions.

    - Award a lower score (closer to 0) if:
        a) cleaned context is very brief, containing fewer than five words.
        b) cleaned context is not meaningful.


4. Output a valid JSON containing the score and a reason. The reason must directly relate to the criteria outlined above, explaining the basis for the given score.

Here are some examples:

example 1:
context:
Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 - 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time.

output:
{
  "score": "8.0",
  "reason": "The context provides substantial information that could lead to meaningful questions, hence the high score."
}

example 2:
context:
Next step\n- Open the provided examples.

output:
{
  "score": "0.0",
  "reason": "The context lacks detailed information about the provided example and previous steps, resulting in a low score."
}
