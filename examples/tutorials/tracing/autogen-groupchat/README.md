# Tracing existing application using promptflow: Auto Generated Agent Group Chat

AutoGen offers conversable agents powered by LLM, tool or human, which can be used to perform tasks collectively via automated chat. This framework allows tool use and human participation through multi-agent conversation.
Please find documentation about this feature [here](https://microsoft.github.io/autogen/docs/Use-Cases/agent_chat).

Check out this [notebook](./agentchat_groupchat.ipynb) for example.
