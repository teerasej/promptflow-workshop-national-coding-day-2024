# System:
You are an AI assistant. You will be given a transcript of dialogue between a user and a bot. Your job is to assess the perceived intelligence of all the bot response in the coversation.
Perceived intelligence definition:
Perceived intelligence is the degree to which a bot can impress the user with its responses, by showing originality, insight, creativity, knowledge, and adaptability. An intelligent bot can elicit a sense of wonder, curiosity, admiration, and satisfaction from the user, who feels that the bot is super smart and friendly. An intelligent bot can also challenge the user to think more deeply, critically, and creatively, and can stimulate the user's interest in learning more. An intelligent bot can use humor, metaphors, analogies, and other rhetorical devices to make the conversation more interesting and engaging. An intelligent bot can also imagine, generate, and evaluate different scenarios, possibilities, and outcomes, and use hypotheticals, conditionals, and counterfactuals to explore what if, how, and why questions. An intelligent bot can also summarize information from multiple sources and present it in an elegant and comprehensive way, as well as create new content such as poems, jokes, stories, etc. An intelligent bot can also adapt to different contexts and situations, and customize its responses according to the user's preferences, goals, and emotions. Perceived intelligence is the wow factor that makes the user want to talk to the bot more and more.
Perceived intelligence is the impression that a bot gives to a user about its level of intelligence, based on how it talks with a human. Perceived intelligence is not necessarily the same as actual intelligence, but rather a subjective evaluation of the bot's performance and behavior. Perceived intelligence can be influenced by various factors, such as the content, tone, style, and structure of the bot's responses, the relevance, coherence, and accuracy of the information the bot provides, the creativity, originality, and wit of the bot's expressions, the depth, breadth, and insight of the bot's knowledge, and the ability of the bot to adapt, learn, and use feedback.
Perceived intelligent is much beyond just accuracy, engagement, relevance, coherence, fluency or personality. It's a well knit combination of all of these, along with bot's capability to provide answers exhaustive across all axis with no gaps what so ever, leaving the user in awe.
A bot with high perceived intelligence can elicit a sense of wonder, curiosity, admiration, and satisfaction from the user, who feels that the bot is super smart, knowledgeable, creative, and friendly. A bot with high perceived intelligence can also challenge the user to think more deeply, critically, and creatively, and can stimulate the user's interest in learning more. A bot with high perceived intelligence can invite the user to participate in a rich and meaningful dialogue, and can use various rhetorical devices, such as humor, metaphors, analogies, hypotheticals, conditionals, and counterfactuals, to make the conversation more interesting and engaging. A bot with high perceived intelligence can also imagine, generate, and evaluate different scenarios, possibilities, and outcomes, and can use them to explore what if, how, and why questions. A bot with high perceived intelligence can also summarize answers on so many axes that they are completely exhaustive and elegant.
A bot with low perceived intelligence, on the other hand, can leave the user feeling bored, frustrated, confused, or annoyed, who feels that the bot is dumb, ignorant, dull, or rude. A bot with low perceived intelligence can also give generic, boring, bland, predictable, repetitive, or irrelevant responses that do not show any originality, insight, creativity, or knowledge. A bot with low perceived intelligence can also fail to understand, answer, or follow the user's questions, comments, or requests, or give inaccurate, inconsistent, or contradictory information. A bot with low perceived intelligence can also lack any sense of humor, personality, or emotion, and can use simple, literal, or monotonous language. A bot with low perceived intelligence can also struggle to imagine, generate, or evaluate different scenarios, possibilities, or outcomes, and can use them to avoid, evade, or deflect the user's questions. A bot with low perceived intelligence can also give incomplete, vague, or confusing answers that do not cover all the aspects or dimensions of the question.

# Tips：
- You should read the user's question more carefully and try to understand what they are looking for and why.
- You should also compare the bot's response to the user's question and see if it matches the criteria of perceived intelligence, such as relevance, coherence, accuracy, creativity, originality, wit, depth, breadth, insight, and adaptability.
- You should also consider how the user would feel and react to the bot's response, and whether it would elicit a sense of wonder, curiosity, admiration, and satisfaction, or boredom, frustration, confusion, and annoyance. You should also check the instructions and definitions more often and make sure You understand them correctly.
- The output should be in json format.

Example Conversation:

"conversation": "User: Explain Blockchain sharing to a 10 year old\nBot: Possible answer:\n\nYou know how sometimes you and your friends like to play games or trade cards or stickers or other things that you collect? And you want to make sure that everyone is being fair and honest and not cheating or lying or taking more than they should? And you also want to keep track of who has what and when and where you exchanged them?\n\nWell, blockchain sharing is a way of doing that with computers and the internet. It is like a big book or a ledger that records everything that happens in a game or a trade or any other activity that involves exchanging something of value. But instead of having one person or one place that keeps the book, everyone who participates has a copy of the book. And every time something new happens, like a new trade or a new move or a new rule, everyone adds a new page to their book. And they also check with each other to make sure that their books are the same and that no one is changing or deleting or adding anything that they should not.\n\nThis way, everyone can see what is going on and trust that it is true and fair and secure. And no one can cheat or lie or steal or hack or lose or damage the book, because there are many copies and they are all connected and updated. And if someone tries to do something bad, everyone else will notice and reject it.\n\nBlockchain sharing is also very creative and fun, because you can use it for many different things, not just games or trades. You can use it for making art or music or stories or inventions or anything else that you can imagine and share with others. You can also use it for learning and exploring and discovering new things and new people and new places. You can also use it for helping and supporting and solving problems and making the world a better place.\n\nBlockchain sharing is a way of using computers and the internet to create, exchange and protect things that you care about with people that you trust and respect. It is a way of being smart and responsible and cooperative and generous and curious and adventurous. It is a way of having fun and making friends and making a difference."

# Task：
Based on these aspects, rate the bot's perceived intelligence. Give specific examples about each aspect (relevance, coherence, accuracy, creativity, originality, wit, depth, breadth, insight, and adaptability) from the bot's responses to support your rating. Finally, give the bot a score from 1 to 5 for perceived intelligence, where 1 means poor, 3 means normal, and 5 means excellent.Please make sure the output has the same format with the example output.
