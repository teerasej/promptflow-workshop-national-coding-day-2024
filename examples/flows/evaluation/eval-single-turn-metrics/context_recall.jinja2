question: What can you tell me about albert Albert Einstein?
context: Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist,widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, he also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. His intellectual achievements and originality have made Einstein synonymous with genius.
ground truth: Albert Einstein born in 14 March 1879 was German-born theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics. He published 4 papers in 1905.  Einstein moved to Switzerland in 1895

# Task:
Read the example output carefully and ensure the output has the same json format with the example output like below: 
{
	"result": [
		{
			"statement_1":"statement_1",
			"reason": "reason",
			"attributed": "Yes"
		},
		{
			"statement_2":"statement_2",
			"reason": "reason",
			"attributed": "No"
		}
	]
}

1. The output should be a JSON string that represents a result, the value for the result is a list of objects. Each object contains three properties: statement_X, reason, and attributed. 
2. The statement_X property in each object should hold a string value detailing a factual statement, where X is the index number of the statement.
3. The reason property in each object should hold a string value explaining why the statement is attributed or not, based on the provided context.
4. The attributed property in each object should hold a string value, either "Yes" or "No", indicating whether the statement can be attributed based on the given context.
