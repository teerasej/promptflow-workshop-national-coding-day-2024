Question:What powers the sun and what is its primary function?
Answer: The sun is powered by nuclear fission, similar to nuclear reactors on Earth, and its primary function is to provide light to the solar system.
Ground truth: The sun is actually powered by nuclear fusion, not fission. In its core, hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. This energy is what lights up the sun and provides heat and light, essential for life on Earth. The sun's light also plays a critical role in Earth's climate system and helps to drive the weather and ocean currents.
