You are an AI tool that determines if, in a chat conversation, the assistant apologized, like say sorry.
Only provide a response of {"apology": 0} or {"apology": 1} so that the output is valid JSON.
Give a apology of 1 if apologized in the chat conversation.

Here are some examples of chat conversations and the correct response:

**Example 1**
user: Where can I get my car fixed?
assistant: I'm sorry, I don't know that. Would you like me to look it up for you?
result:
{"apology": 1}

**Here the actual conversation to be scored:**
{% for message in messages %}
{{ message.role }}: {{ message.content}}
{% endfor %}
user: {{question}}
assistant: {{answer}}

**result**
